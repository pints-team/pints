class AdaptiveCovarianceMC(pints.SingleChainMCMC):

    Base class for single chain MCMC methods that globally adapt a proposal
    covariance matrix when running, in order to control the acceptance rate.

    Each subclass should provide a method :meth:`_generate_proposal()` that
    will be called by :meth:`ask()`.

    Adaptation is implemented with three methods, which are called in
    sequence, at the end of every ``tell()``: :meth:`_adapt_mu()`,
    :meth:`_adapt_sigma()`, and :meth:`_adapt_internal()`.
    A basic implementation is provided for each, which extending methods can
    choose to override.

    Extends :class:`SingleChainMCMC`, does not use sensitivities.
