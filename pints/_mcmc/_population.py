class PopulationMCMC(pints.SingleChainMCMC):
    """
    Creates a chain of samples from a target distribution, using the population
    MCMC (simulated tempering) routine described in algorithm 1 in [1]_.

    This method uses several chains internally, but only a single one is
    updated per iteration, and only a single one is returned at the end, hence
    this method is classified here as a single chain MCMC method.

    The algorithm goes through the following steps (after initialising ``N``
    internal chains):

    1. Mutation: randomly select chain ``i`` and update the chain using a
    Markov kernel that admits ``p_i`` as its invariant distribution.

    2. Exchange: Select another chain ``j`` at random from the remaining and
    swap the parameter vector of ``i`` and ``j`` with probability
    ``min(1, A)``,

    ``A = p_i(x_j) * p_j(x_i) / (p_i(x_i) * p_j(x_j))``

    where ``x_i`` and ``x_j`` are the current values of chains ``i`` and ``j``,
    respectively, where ``p_i = p(theta|data) ^ (1 - T_i)``, where
    ``p(theta|data)`` is the target distribution and ``T_i`` is bounded between
    ``[0, 1]`` and represents a tempering parameter.

    We use a range of ``T = (0,delta_T,...,1)``, where
    ``delta_T = 1 / num_temperatures``, and the chain with ``T_i = 0`` is the
    one whose target distribution we want to sample.

    Extends :class:`SingleChainMCMC`, does not use sensitivities.
